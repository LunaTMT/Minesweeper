If you do not see this you most likely do not have python installed properly on your system. If so, please refer back to the beginning. If you'd like to know more what IDLE is please refer to Real Python's [small introduciton](https://realpython.com/python-idle/#what-is-python-idle) on the topic.

* Once inside the _main.py_ file in your python IDE you can either:
  1. Click _Run_ on the top tab and then click _Run Module_, or
  2. Simply press _F5_
