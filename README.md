If you do not see this you most likely do not have python installed properly on your system. If so, please refer back to the beginning. If you'd like to know more what IDLE is please refer to Real Python's [small introduciton](https://realpython.com/python-idle/#what-is-python-idle) on the topic.

* Once inside the _main.py_ file in your python IDE you can either:
  1. Click _Run_ on the top tab and then click _Run Module_, or
  2. Simply press _F5_

### Personal Overview

The base game for this project took 2 days to make and I'm quite surprised how quickly I was able to accomplish this project. The hardest part of the game was the sweeping algorithm, however, I managed to get this all sorted in an evening. I think the past 3 months of leetcode questions has really helped me get to grips with algorithmic problems and how to go about solving them.

I'd like to give a personal thanks to [fullptr](https://www.reddit.com/user/fullptr/) who gave me some really solid advise about my over usage of classes in my [previous reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/157beuo/my\_third\_project/), as well other advise that really made this project much simpler to make.

The next two days was followed up by refactoring, comments and making the game more presentable.
